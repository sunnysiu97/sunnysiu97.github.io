<h2 id="video game">Video Game</h2>
Ever since I was young, I was into playing video games. Then I've started getting into competitive play instead of casual. I played in tournaments for a couple games and it is required to have a great deal of skill and technique to compete. Video games was something I enjoyed, but could be compared towards design patterns. As we all know, playing games requires certain techniques to beat the game, and we can not implement the same technique cannot be applied to the differnet games, which in design pattern's terms.
<h2 id="video games to design pattern">Video Games to Design Pattern</h2>
Design patterns is basically a general solution to solve problems within a given context. It's not a finished design, but it could be used directly to turn it into a useable program for softwares. In computer programming, it is a well thought-out template that has to be implmented in the correct situation. If used in the wrong situation, it would not make the template work which would end up causing problems. We could say that in a way, game techniques could be compared to our design pattern. It's basically how the techniques we use when playing games to boost our performance as to how we use the template to boost our performance. Now, let's say we tweak it a little. Can we use different game techniques on different games that we play. For example: could you use your tetris technique for a shooting game? This would beconsidered a wrong situation because it will cause other problems. So instead, we need to make another 'design pattern' for a shooting game.

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

Video game is a very fun activity and it requires great techinique to reach the highest level. Like mastering the techniques in video games, using design patterns can be very useful as a computer programmer, because it's efficient. You are basically solving a problem again if you don't utilize design patterns. By reusing a template or creating a template base on what you want, it will be very helpful.
