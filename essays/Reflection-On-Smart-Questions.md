After reading Eric Raymond's <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>, it tells us how important it is being able to ask "smart questions" is a skill for software programers. Asking questions the right way will offer yourself more effective help from others, while asking questions the wrong way will offer yourself less help, as well as waste others' time for helping you. In order to look for good and bad examples, I took a look at questions asked in StackOverflow.
