After reading Eric Raymond's <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How To Ask Questions The Smart Way</a>, it tells us how important it is being able to ask "smart questions" is a skill for software programers. Asking questions the right way will offer yourself more effective help from others, while asking questions the wrong way will offer yourself less help, as well as waste others' time for helping you. In order to look for good and bad examples, I took a look at questions asked in StackOverflow.

Dump and bad questions you would ask would be just questions that you can google up. This post would be a perfect example of how someone asks a bad question, with its vague title, unclear description of problem / desired output, no examples of code, no prior research were included. According to Eric Raymondâ€™s guidelines, this question has little chance of providing effective and efficient help, if anyone even bothers to answer it. This question is new but I high doubt anyone would provide an answer because of the lack of effort. The reason for why I thought this to be a bad example of question asking is that the question asked showed lack of effort in finding the answer for himself or even giving examples of what he has tried.
