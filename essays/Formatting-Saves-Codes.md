I didn't learn about how important formatting was in code until about a semester ago in ICS212. When it came to big homework and projects, it became obvious how much coding format affects the coder. Small things like "double space", <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50642729/select-everything-after-a-certain-word-regular-expression?rq=1">instead of "tab" because a tab could mean different numbers of column in different environments, however, a space will always be one index.</a>

In coding, there's a lot more formatting than I would have thought, if I based the formatting off of my own way, it would have looked like a mess. But good thing there are specific code formats to follow by. Another example would be the placement of curlyly brackets, " { ". 
This could be helpful because you could catch yourself on your own mistakes if there are curly brackets that are missing in your code or your functions. If I were to pick which is the most important coding format to have in mind when learning how to code; I would choose the correct placements of curly brackets because it will save you a lot of time if you're trying to figure out how to fix your code.

Regardless how small the error is; it is better to fix it so it becomes a habit for you later on in your coding career. You probably wouldn't want to look at someone's code that you're collaborating with and be like " What in the world am I looking at." If you don't want that, why would you want to confuse someone else with your code. Make it a habit, make sure you code in the correct format.
