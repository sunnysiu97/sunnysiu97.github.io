summary: A banking record I programmed for ICS 212
---

Bank record program was created for a project in ICS212. It is coded in C++ on uhunix. It was a solo project which lasted over weeks. The usable options for the menu to the bank record was to add a new record in the database, which need to include your name, address, and an account number you wish to have. The second option would be to print out information about a specific record using account number as the key. The third option would be to print all information in the database. Fourth option would to delete an existing record the database using an account number as the key, if there wasn't an account of such, it would return "Not in system". Fifth option would be to reverse the record in the database and print the record, for example, instead of print 101 first, the highest account number would be printed first. Sixth would be to exit the program without any errors. 

This project took me a long time because of how new everything was to me, I've never coded in C++ nor have I use uhunix or a terminal to code. Therefore it took me a while to transition to C++ because I was so used to using Java. I would ran into a lot of errors but I had TA and friends debugging the code where I couldn't figure out what was wrong. Overall, it was a good experience because it was different from ICS111, taking a step away from creating games. Stepping a bit more into creating programs in a real life situation.
